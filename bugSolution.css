The solution involves prioritizing the `:focus-visible` styles and structuring the CSS appropriately to avoid conflicts with custom focus styles:

```css
.my-element {
  /* Other styles */
}

.my-element:focus {
  /* Common focus styles, if any, should be applied here instead of the :focus-visible */
}

.my-element:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
  box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5);
}

.my-element.focused {
  /* Add custom styles as needed, but keep this separate from :focus-visible */
}
```

The JavaScript remains largely the same but now works in harmony with a well structured CSS.  This separation of `:focus`, and `:focus-visible` styles provides more control and predictability ensuring `:focus-visible` takes precedence when it is needed.  It's important to test thoroughly across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
